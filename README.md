First project for <a href="https://www.dailyui.co/">Daily UI's</a> 100 Days of UI Challenge. The prompt was to create a sign-up form for anything you could think of. I chose a basic news-aggregating subscription service and created this appealing user interface. I struggled to achieve the ripped-paper effect with pure CSS before eventually deciding to create a ripped paper image myself and use that as the background.</p>
